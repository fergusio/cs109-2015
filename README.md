All right, this git repo is me working through the CS109 class, one lab at a time.

To start:
- [Lecture videos & notes](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html)

My notes are here in the readme file as I work through the [course syllabus](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/schedule.html). 

## Week 1: What is Data Science

Starting with [Lecture 1](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Lectures/01-Introduction.pdf)

There are three very introductory notebooks: [pythonpandas](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/Lab1-pythonpandas.ipynb), followed by [babypython](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/Lab1-babypython.ipynb), and finally [git](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/Lab1-git.ipynb). However, since the course dates back to 2015, some of the python is a bit dated and uses 2.x code. 

After doing the three intro notebooks, [hw0](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/hw0.ipynb) runs you through installing anaconda, git, and setting up a github and aws account.

Hw0 has one interesting section, where you solve the montyhall problem one step at a time. I didn't really like their steps, so made a [simpler monty hall implementation](https://github.com/khalido/algorithims/blob/master/monty_hall.ipynb).
