All right, this git repo is me working through the CS109 class, one lab at a time.

To start:
- [Lecture videos & notes](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html)

My notes are here in the readme file as I work through the [course syllabus](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/schedule.html). 

**Study Suggestions before starting:**

- Use a internet blocker app [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) to stop procrastinating and a [pomodoro app] to break up study into chunks. 
- Buy a paper notebook and write notes as you watch the videos and do the labs.
- Get a second monitor so you can watch videos/have lab notebooks & pdf open and work through at the same time.
- Don't look at the lab and hw answers - try to do them first on your own.

## Week 1: What is Data Science

Starting with [Lecture 1](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Lectures/01-Introduction.pdf)

There are three very introductory notebooks: [pythonpandas](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/Lab1-pythonpandas.ipynb), followed by [babypython](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/Lab1-babypython.ipynb), and finally [git](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/Lab1-git.ipynb). However, since the course dates back to 2015, some of the python is a bit dated and uses 2.x code. 

After doing the three intro notebooks, [hw0](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/hw0.ipynb) runs you through installing anaconda, git, and setting up a github and aws account.

Hw0 has one interesting section, where you solve the montyhall problem one step at a time. I didn't really like their steps, so made a [simpler monty hall implementation](https://github.com/khalido/algorithims/blob/master/monty_hall.ipynb). 

## Week 2: Intro Data Analysis and Viz

The lecture 2 notebook goes through getting data and putting it into a pandas dataframe.
Hw 1

## Week 3 : Databases, SQL and more Pandas

## Week 4: Regression

HW 2

## Week 5: Scikit learn

## Week 6: SVM, trees and forests

Pitch a project idea (to study group or the internet at large).

hw 3

## Week 7: Machine Learning best practices

Around Week 7 or 8, start [project](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/projects.html).

> Towards the end of the course you will work on a month-long data science project. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, run statistical analysis, and communicate the results. You will work closely with other classmates in a 3-4 person project team.


## Week 8: EC2 and Spark

hw4

## Week 9: Bayes!

## Week 10: Text

hw5

## Week 11: Clustering!

## Week 12: Deep LEarning

## Week 13: Final Project & Wrapup
