All right, this git repo is me working through [Harvard's 2015 CS109 class](http://cs109.github.io/2015/), one lab at a time.

To start:
- [Lecture videos & notes](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html)

Note: download the videos using [this script](https://github.com/christopher-beckham/cs109-dl-videos), and merge [pull request 11](https://github.com/christopher-beckham/cs109-dl-videos/pull/11) to get the 2015 videos.

My notes are here in the readme file as I work through the [course syllabus](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/schedule.html) and the [labs and homeworks](https://porter.io/github.com/cs109/content). 

**Study Suggestions before starting:**

- Use a internet blocker app [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) to stop procrastinating and a [pomodoro app] to break up study into chunks. 
- Buy a paper notebook and write notes as you watch the videos and do the labs.
- Get a second monitor so you can watch videos/have lab notebooks open and work through at the same time.
- Don't look at the lab and hw answers - try to do them first on your own. Discuss with others before looking at solutions.

## Week 1: What is Data Science

[Lecture 1](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Lectures/01-Introduction.pdf):

- introduces data science.  
 

## Week 2: Intro Data Analysis and Viz

The lecture 2 notebook goes through getting data and putting it into a pandas dataframe.

Lab 1 has three very introductory notebooks: [pythonpandas](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1/Lab1-pythonpandas.ipynb), followed by [babypython](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1/Lab1-babypython.ipynb), and finally [git](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1/Lab1-git.ipynb). However, since the course dates back to 2015, some of the python is a bit dated and uses 2.x code. 

After doing the three intro notebooks, [hw0](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1/hw0.ipynb) runs you through installing anaconda, git, and setting up a github and aws account.

Hw0 has one interesting section, where you solve the [montyhall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) one step at a time. I didn't really like their steps, so made a [simpler monty hall implementation](https://github.com/khalido/algorithims/blob/master/monty_hall.ipynb).

Moving on to the [Lecture 2](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Lectures/02-DataScraping.ipynb) & its [quiz notebook](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Lectures/02-DataScrapingQuizzes.ipynb), this goes through some more pandas and data scraping web pages and parsing them.

I made a couple of notebooks 

- [movielens notebook for basic pandas](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/movielens.ipynb) workflow of downloading a zip file, extracting it and putting into pandas dataframes and doing some q&a
- [twitter notebook](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/twitter.ipynb) - basic usage of twitter api and doing something with tweets 

**Lecture 3** ([slides](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Lectures/03-EDA.pdf), [video](https://matterhorn.dce.harvard.edu/engage/player/watch.html?id=a4e81697-fd86-415c-9b29-c14ea7ec15f2)):

 - ask a q, get data to answer it, explore & check data, then model it and finally communicate and visualize the results.
 - keep viz simple and think of the [kind of chart](http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/files/choosing_a_good_chart.pdf) needed. 


## Week 3 : Databases, SQL and more Pandas

## Week 4: Regression

HW 2

## Week 5: Scikit learn

## Week 6: SVM, trees and forests

Pitch a project idea (to study group or the internet at large).

hw 3

## Week 7: Machine Learning best practices

Around Week 7 or 8, start [project](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/projects.html).

> Towards the end of the course you will work on a month-long data science project. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, run statistical analysis, and communicate the results. You will work closely with other classmates in a 3-4 person project team.


## Week 8: EC2 and Spark

hw4

## Week 9: Bayes!

## Week 10: Text

hw5

## Week 11: Clustering!

## Week 12: Deep LEarning

## Week 13: Final Project & Wrapup
