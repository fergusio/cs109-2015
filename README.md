All right, this git repo is me working through the CS109 class, one lab at a time.

To start:
- [Lecture videos & notes](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html)

My notes are here in the readme file as I work through the course.

# Week 1: 

Starting with [Lecture 1](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Lectures/01-Introduction.pdf)

There are three very introductory notebooks: [pythonpandas](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/Lab1-pythonpandas.ipynb), followed by [babypython](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/Lab1-babypython.ipynb, and finally [git](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/Lab1-git.ipynb). However, since the course dates back to 2015, some of the python is a bit dated and uses 2.x code. 

After doing the three intro notebooks, [hw0](https://github.com/khalido/cs109-2015/blob/master/Labs/2015lab1-master/hw0.ipynb) runs you through installing anaconda, git, and setting up a github and aws account.

Hw0 has one interesting section, where you solve the montyhall problem one step at a time. I didn't really like their steps, so made a [simpler monty hall implementation](https://github.com/khalido/algorithims/blob/master/monty_hall.ipynb). 

# Week 2


# The original readme from the 2015 class: 

##Lectures

The Lecture slides up to Lecture 1 are in this repository. Just click on the Lectures Folder.

##Lab 1

https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1

The git lab can be read [here](https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1/blob/master/Lab1-git.ipynb).

##HW 0

You can read it [here](https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1/blob/master/hw0.ipynb).

The repository is at:

https://github.com/cs109-students/2015hw

Switch to branch hw0.

You will not be able to access the above link if you have not been added to the cs109-students github organization. For this to happen, you must have submitted the survey, and it will take a bit of time for us to get to your github id after that.

For this reason, we have included HW0 in the lab link above.

At that point, homework repositories will be created for you.

##Initial Workflow

- read hw 0, and do the survey and installations
- then read the git lab in lab 1 linked from within.
- read the git flows at the end of both these documents
- now clone the lab repository. (workflow is in the README and at the end of hw 0)
- Run the hw0.ipynb file, installing additional python libraries
- run all the lab notebooks, including the git notebook, to get familiar with python, pandas and git

By this point you should have a cs109-students/githubuserid-2015hw repository, - which you should clone, and carry out the homework flow on. (homework flow is in the README for https://github.com/cs109-students/2015hw and at the end of hw0.ipynb (https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1/blob/master/hw0.ipynb) and (https://github.com/cs109/2015lab1/blob/master/Lab1-git.ipynb).
